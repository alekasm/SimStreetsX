This notes text file has a random assortment of information that may
or may not be used directly in the future by the SimStreetsX patcher. It
is meant to keep track of my findings regarding the engine.


----- Functions -----
0x4AB3D0 = Render Update Function
0x450F40 = UI Rendering (Radar, Gauges, etc)
0x49A7F0 = Returns the result of 0xA0B824 (View Angle)


----- Global Variables -----
0xB27A58:
Should Render World. 1 = false, 0 = true

0xA0B824:
View Angle. 0 = cockpit, 1 - 5 = camera view outside
Technically it's [0xA0B820 + 0x4] (unsure why this is in disassembly)


----- High Resolution Issues -----

1. Main issue on higher resolution is various crashes. The most reliable patch so far
is to jump over function 0x4B3B00 in function 0x4AB7B0 at location 0x4AB906. 

Change:
cmp byte_89633C, bl
jnz loc_4AB92D

To:
nop
jmp loc_4AB92D

Still need to investigate why 0x4B3B00 is and what the effects of not calling it are.

2. Investigate the following series of rendering functions/variables:

0x4AB3D0:
Resets various variables besed on time, currently on a 2000ms check. The "main
variables" in this is 0x6293E4 and 0xB27A58. If both are not active, the other
rendering functions return almost immediately.

0x4AB410/0x4AB550:
These functions have a very similar design except 

0x4AB410 calls another function: 0x4ABC00
0x4AB550 instead calls function: 0x4AC030

Both functions have some check against the number "15000"

0x4AB7B0:
Seems to be the "main" rendering function of sorts, and it's the only function that willa ctually reset 0x6293E4. 
This function contains both the show_debug variable and 0x4B3B00, the function which crashes on higher resolutions.


3. Investigate why the skybox doesn't render the full width of the screen in high resolution, high textures - 
however it renders correctly (full width) in high resolution, low, low/high textures.


4. The code is littered with hard-coded values for 640x480 and results in various UI problems and crashes in different
parts of the code. One part is the game setup in function 0x453160. Correcting the width/height in this function
helps with menu crashes, still needs testing.



4A3680 = voodoo rush patch version?
